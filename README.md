SightAssist: AI-Powered Object Recognition for Visual Accessibility
# Description: 
SightAssist is an innovative mobile application designed to empower individuals with 
visual impairments by providing real-time object recognition and detailed audio descriptions of 
their surroundings. Utilizing state-of-the-art computer vision (YOLOv8) and generative AI 
models, the app identifies objects through a smartphone camera and converts this information into natural language descriptions. With text-to-speech integration, users can receive intuitive and accessible audio feedback, promoting independence and safety in navigating their daily 
environment.
# Problem Statement:

Individuals with visual impairments face significant challenges in navigating their 
environment and recognizing objects, which impacts their independence and quality of life. While 
assistive technologies exist, many lack real-time, context-aware descriptions that are both intuitive and accessible.

This project aims to address these challenges by developing an AI-powered mobile application 
that combines computer vision and generative AI to provide real-time object recognition and audio descriptions, enabling users to interact with their surroundings more effectively and safely.
